# discord-openapi-client

> [!WARNING]
> This is work in progress.

Autogenerated OpenAPI client for Discord, generated from [discord/discord-api-spec](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-spec).

This should contain _almost_ everything you will need to interact with the Discord API, atleast whatever their OpenAPI spec has.

There are absolutely no dependencies apart from the presence of `fetch()`, which should just be supported in all modern runtimes. I would also recommend using a bundler if you're using this in size-constraint environments like Cloudflare Workers, as this package is quite big.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> This package is ESM only.

Install package:

```sh
# @antfu/ni
ni discord-openapi-client
```

Import:

```js
import {
  getUser /* Import functions you need */,
  getGetUserUrl /* functions that will return the absolute url string */,
} from "discord-openapi-client";
```

All mutation functions are available under prefixes: `get`, `update`, `delete`, etc.

If you just need the URL with proper URL encoding, those are suffixed with `Url`, which will return the absolute API URL.

Types for responses, params, 200s are available respectively.

## Building

1. Install dependencies with pnpm
2. Clone `discord/discord-api-spec` as `openapi`
3. Run `pnpm build`
